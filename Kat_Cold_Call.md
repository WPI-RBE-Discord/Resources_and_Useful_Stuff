For anyone who might need it (definitely not related to any phone calls I may have just received), here's a handy script for cold-calling:

<ol>
  <li>

    Dial correct number, wait for answer. Human or machine, it doesn't matter.
  
  </li>
  <li>
  
    "Hello, my name is _____. I'd like to speak with (name of office or name of specific person)."
  </li>
  <li>
  
    A. If a machine answered, go to step 7; else continue.

    B. If they say "This is (name of office or person you wanted)" or similar, go to step 5; else continue.

    C. If they say "You've got the wrong number" or similar, say "I'm sorry -- is there a better number to reach (Name of Institution/Business)'s (name of office) OR (name of specific person)?"

  </li>
  <li>

    A. If they say "This is (really the wrong number)," say "I'm sorry, I'll try again, thank you!", hang up, go to step 1; else continue.

    B. If they say yes, get number, say "Thank you very much", hang up, go to step 1; else continue.

    C. If they say yes and offer to transfer you, say "I would appreciate that. May I have their number, in case we get disconnected?" Whether they give you the number or not, say "Thank you very much," and STAY ON THE LINE. If you get disconnected, go to step 1; else go to step 2.

    D. If they say "Yes, this is (name), how may I help you?" or similar, continue.

  </li>
  <li>

    "Would you be able to (do a task explained in one-sentence or less)?"

  </li>
  <li>

    A. If they say no, say "I understand. Is there a better person\place I should call to (do this task)?" and go to step 4.

    B. If they say yes, go to step 7. 

  </li>
  <li>

    Provide a short summary of what you want from them.

  </li>
  <li>

    A. If a machine, say "Again, this is (your name), and I can be reached at (your phone number). That's (phone number again, slowly)." Go to step 9.

    B. If a human, presumably you will now get the answer to your question, or you'll work with the person to get your task accomplished, etc.

  </li>
  <li>

    When you're done, say "Thank you for your time" or similar and hang up. 
  </li>
</ol>

Done!
